<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>POPULAR STORIES OF THE ENGLISH PEASANTRY,</h3>

<p class="ac">NO. V.</p>

  <p>By far the larger portion of our tales consist of those connected with
  the popular mythology of elves, and giants, and bleeding trees; of
  witches and their wicked doings; of frogs that <i>would</i> go a-wooing,
  and got turned into princes; and amorous princes who became frogs; of
  primitive rough chests transformed into coaches; young ladies who go to
  bed young ladies, and get up owls; much despised younger sons crowned
  kings of boundless realms; and mediæval tabbies getting inducted into
  flourishing vizierships by the mere loss of their tails: stories, in
  short, of the metamorphosis of all conceivable things into all
  conceivable shapes. Lest this catalogue should frighten your readers, I
  at once disavow any intention of reflecting more than a specimen. Their
  puerility renders them scarcely suitable to your columns, and there is
  moreover such a sameness in those best worth preserving&mdash;the fairy
  legends&mdash;that a single example would be amply sufficient for our
  purpose of pointing out the different varieties of oral romance. Whenever
  the story relates to the dealings of the fairy-folk with mankind, the elf
  is almost always represented as the dupe; while, in his transactions with
  rival supernaturals, he invariably comes off victorious. Giants
  especially, being always of sleepy and obtuse intellect, afford a fine
  field for the display of his powers; and we find him baffling their
  clumsy plans, as well also as the more cunning devices of weird-sisters,
  in a manner which proves him to be a worthy scion of the warlike
  <i>avenger</i> of the Sagar. The lovers of folk-lore will probably agree
  with me in regarding the following tale as a choice bit of elfin history,
  illustrating the not very amicable relations of the witches and the good
  people. No sneers, therefore, gentle readers, but listen to the simple
  strain of "Fairy Jip and Witch One-eye."</p>

  <p>Once upon a time, just before the monkey tribe gave up the nauseous
  custom of chewing tobacco, there lived an old hag, who had conceived an
  inordinate desire to eat an elf: a circumstance, by the way, which
  indubitably establishes that elves were <!-- Page 602 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page602"></a>{602}</span>of masticable solidity,
  and not, as some one has it, mere</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Shadowry</i> dancers by the summer streams."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So the old lady went to the place where the fairies dwelt, and knocked
  at the hill-top:&mdash;"Pretty little Jip!" said she; "come and see the
  sack of cherries I have brought thee, <i>so</i> large, <i>so</i> red,
  <i>so</i> sweet." Fairies, be it known, are extremely fond of this fruit,
  and the elf rushed out in eager haste. "Ha! ha!" said One-eye, as she
  pounced upon him, and put him in her bag (witches always carry bags),
  "take care the stones don't stick in thy throttle, my little bird." On
  the way home, she has to visit a place some distance from the road, and
  left Jip meanwhile in the charge of a man who was cutting faggots. No
  sooner was her back turned, than Jip begged the man to let him out; and
  they filled the bag with thorns. One-eye called for her burden, and set
  off towards home, making sure she had her dinner safe on her back. "Ay,
  ay! my lad," said she, as she felt the pricking of the thorns; "I'll
  trounce thee when I get home for stinging me with thy pins and needles."
  When she reached her house, she belaboured the bag with a huge stick,
  till she thought she had broken every bone in the elf's body; and when
  she found that she had been wasting her strength upon a "kit" of thorns,
  her rage knew no bounds. Next day, she again got possession of Jip in a
  similar manner, and this time left him in care of a man who was breaking
  stones by the road-side. The elf makes his escape as before, and they
  fill the sack with stones. "Thou little rogue!" said the witch, as she
  perspired under the burden; "I'll soften thy bones nigh-hand." Her
  appetite was only whetted, not blunted, by these repeated failures, and
  despairing of again catching her prey in the same way as before, she
  assumed the shape of a pedlar with a churn on his shoulder, and contrived
  to meet Jip in a wood. "Ah! Master Redcap," quoth she; "look alive, my
  little man, the fox is after thee. See! here he comes: hie thee into my
  churn, and I will shelter thee. Quick! quick!" In jumped the elf. "Pretty
  bird!" chuckled the old Crocodile; "dost thee scent the fox?" This time
  she went straight home, and gave Jip to her daughter, with strict orders
  that she should cut off his noddle and boil it. When the time came for
  beginning the cooking, Miss One-eye led her captive to the
  chopping-block, and bade him lay down his head. "How?" quoth Jip; "I
  don't know how." "Like this, to be sure," said she; and, suiting the
  action to the word, she put her poll in the right position. Instantly the
  fairy seizes the hatchet, and serves her in the manner she intended to
  serve him. Then picking up a huge pebble, he climbs up the chimney to
  watch the progress of events. As he expected, the witch came to the fire
  to look after her delicacy; and no sooner does she lift up the lid of the
  pot, than "plop" came down Jip's pebble right into the centre of her
  remaining optic, the light of which is extinguished for ever; or,
  according to some versions, killed her <i>stone</i><span
  class="nw">-dead.</span><a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Some of the stories are so extremely like the German ones, that, with
  very slight alterations, they would serve as translations. These, for
  obvious reasons, it will not be worth while to trouble you with. Among
  them, I may particularise the following from the <i>Kinder und
  Hausmärchen</i>:&mdash;Hans im Gluck: Der Frieder und das Catherlieschen;
  Von der Frau Füchsin; and Van den Nachandel-Boom.</p>

  <p>Modern tales of diablerie are not so uncommon as might be expected. In
  the time of Chaucer, the popular belief ascribed the departure of the
  elves to the great number of wandering friars who mercilessly pursued
  them with bell, book, and candle; and at the present day, in the opinion
  of our uneducated peasantry, the itinerant sectarian preachers are
  endowed with similar attributes. The stories told of these men, and their
  encounters with the powers of darkness, would fill a new Golden Legend.
  There is one tale in particular which comes within our designation of
  "popular stories," as is well known in almost all parts of
  England,&mdash;How a godly minister falls over the company of wicked
  scoffing elves, and how he gets out.<a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The last time I heard it, it was
  related of a preacher of the Ranting persuasion, well known some dozen
  years ago in a certain district of Warwickshire; and I prefer to give it
  in this localised form, as it enables me to present your readers with
  "Positively the last from Fairyland."</p>

  <p>Providence B&mdash;&mdash; was a well-known man throughout that whole
  country-side. He had made more converts than all his brethren put
  together, and, in the matter of spirits and demons, would stand a
  comparison with Godred or Gutlac, or, by'r Lady, St. Anthony himself. Now
  it fell out one day, that Providence was sent for to the house of a
  wealthy yeoman to aid in expelling an evil spirit which had long infested
  his daughter. I must here remark, <i>en parenthèse</i>, that scenes of
  this fearfully ludicrous nature are far from unfrequent in our country
  districts. The besotted state of ignorance in which a great portion of
  our rural population are still enwrapt, renders them peculiarly open to
  the fleecing of these fanatics, who, marvellous to relate, are almost
  everywhere <!-- Page 603 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page603"></a>{603}</span>looked upon with respect, and treated with
  the greatest consideration, proving incontestably that,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Mad as Christians used to be</p>
      <p class="i1">About the seventeenth century,</p>
      <p class="i1">There's others to be had</p>
      <p>In this the nineteenth just as bad."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>On this occasion the job proved a tough one, and it was not till a
  late hour that Prov. set off on his road home. It was a pitchy dark
  night, and somehow or other the preacher and his nag contrived to lose
  their way among the green lanes, and it was not till they had floundered
  about for some time that our hero discerned (as is usual in such cases) a
  light gleaming through the thick foliage before him, which he
  incontinently discovers to proceed from a solitary dwelling in the middle
  of the woods. <i>Of course</i> he dismounts, and knocks at the door; and
  <i>of course</i> it was opened by a suspicious-looking old woman in
  toggery which it would do Mr. James's heart good to depict. To his
  request for a night's lodging, she yielded a ready assent&mdash;too
  ready, Prov. thought; for it seemed from her manner as though he had been
  expected. He was shown into a bed-room, and was proceeding to divest
  himself of his garments, when he hears a knock at the door, and a voice
  asked him to come down to supper. Prov. made answer that he didn't want
  any, that he was in bed, and that moreover he was engaged at his
  devotions; but presently the messenger returned, and declared that if he
  did not join the company downstairs, they would come and sup with him.
  Poor Prov. quaked with fright, but thought it politic to cloak his fears,
  so followed the servant to the house-room, where there were a number of
  people sitting round a table plentifully laden with good things. All of
  them were little "shrivelled up" old men; and, as the chairman motioned
  Prov. to a vacant seat, they all regarded him with a stare that made him
  feel the reverse of jolly. Although he is well acquainted with the
  neighbourhood, he recognises none of them. The meal proceeded in solemn
  silence: look which way he would, he encounters the gaze of his
  companions, who appear to scowl at him with an expression of fiendish
  hate. Dreadful surmises flit across his brain. Suddenly his attention
  becomes directed to the posterior portion of the gentleman next him. "By
  Jove! he has a tail. Yes, he has; and so has his neighbour, and so have
  they all." He fancies too he can trace a resemblance between the
  individual who sits at the head of the table and the fiend of the
  morning's exorcism. All is now clear as a pike-staff. It is a decided
  case of trepan. That dark fellow on the right has to complain of a
  forcible ejection from a comfortable dwelling in the portly corpus of
  Master Muggins the miller; and he on the left is the identical demon who
  got into Farmer Nelson's cow, and gave our hero a world of trouble to get
  him out. He is in the power of the incubi, whom he has been so long
  warring against. Not a moment is to be lost, for already they are
  whispering together, and the scowls get fiercer and fiercer. What is to
  be done? A monk would have had recourse to his breviary; Prov. thought of
  his hymn-book. "Brethren," says he, "it is usual wi' us at the heend of a
  feast to ax a blessing."</p>

  <p>"A blessing quotha! and to <i>us</i>?" roared the fiends. "Ha! ha!
  Yea! yea!" said Prov.; and <i>instanter</i> he out with that
  <i>spirit-stirring</i> stanza of "immortal John:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Jesus the name, high over all,</p>
      <p>In hell, or earth, or sky,</p>
      <p>Angels and men before Him fall,</p>
      <p>And devils fear and fly!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Who shall depict the scene while these words were being uttered? The
  old men turn all sorts of colours, from green to blue, and blue to green,
  and back again to their original hue. At the last line, the uproar
  becomes terrible; and, amidst shouts of fiendish wailing, the whole
  company resolve themselves into a thin blue smoke, in which state they
  career up the chimney, taking with them a bran new chimney-pot, and
  leaving behind a most offensive odour of lucifer matches. Prov. saw no
  more; he fainted.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Some scandalous fellows spread abroad a report that the morning's sun
  discovered our valiant vessel snugly ensconced in a dry ditch; but as he
  always denounced strong waters, and was moreover a leading member of the
  Steeple "United Totals," I, for one, do not believe it. From the examples
  already given, I trust your readers will think with me that these old
  world relics are worth preserving. I hope they will not be backward in
  the good work. A few more years, and the scheme of an English work on the
  plan of Grimm's will be impracticable. The romance-lore, both oral and
  written, which erewhile delighted the cottager, is growing out of date.
  The prosy narrative of "How John the serving-man wedded an earl's
  daughter, and became a squire of high degree;" and the less placid, but
  still intolerably dull feats of the "Seven Champions," have no charms for
  him now. He has outgrown the old chap-book literature, and affectionates
  the highly seasoned atrocities of the Old Bailey school; which, to the
  disgrace of the legislature, are allowed to poison the minds of our
  labouring community with their weekly broad-sheets of crime and
  obscenity. Even those prime old favourites, the <i>Robin Hood Garland</i>
  and <i>Shepherd's Kalendar</i>, with its quaint letter-press and grim
  woodcuts, are getting out of fashion, and beginning to be missed from
  their accustomed nook beside the family Bible.</p>

  <p>P.S. Owing to some unaccountable inadvertence, I have only just seen
  the number of "N.&amp; Q." containing the highly interesting
  communications of H. B. C. and <span class="sc">Mr. Stephens</span>. Will
  <span class="sc">Mr. Stephens</span> allow me to ask him where he
  procured his tale, for I agree with H. B. C. that it is "desirable to fix
  the localities as nearly as possible." My version came from the
  Gloucestershire side of the county.</p>

  <p>I use the term <i>elves</i> advisedly; for though, of course, the

  <p>As your valuable paper is in the hands of scholars of every
  description in every part of the world, the following communication may
  meet the eye, and be of no slight interest to some of your classical
  readers, and, at the same time, give a stimulus to hunters at bookstalls.
  Some time since, in one of my hunts, I stumbled upon a very fine copy of
  Pet. Victorine's (Vettori) edition of Æschylus, printed by H. Stephens,
  1557. I was much gratified in finding it had belonged to the celebrated
  Thomas Morell, D.D., F.R.S., F.S.A., the lexicographer, and had his
  book-plate and autograph. The margins were filled with many conjectures
  and emendations written in two very ancient hands, and, besides, some
  MSS. Scholia on the <i>Prometheus</i> and <i>Poesæ</i>. In carefully
  examining them I found many were marked with the letters (A) and (P). I
  remembered the present very learned Bishop of London, in the preface to
  his edition of the <i>Choæphoræ</i>, mentioned the vast assistance he had
  received in editing that play from a copy of this very edition of
  Æschylus (H. Stephens, 1557), lent to him by Mr. Mitford, the margins of
  which were similarly marked. The bishop observes these emendations were
  by Auratus and Portus, two learned French scholars; and that Mr.
  Mitford's volume contained several other emendations without the
  signatures (A) and (P), which he, for distinction's sake, marked (Q). Now
  my copy also possessed these readings marked (Q). The bishop further
  observed, that the writer of the MSS. notes was a cotemporary of
  Casaubon's from a remark at p. 14. of the volume. The learned bishop's
  description of the volume will be found in the <i>Museum Criticum</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 488. I at first imagined I had met with this identical
  volume; but a closer examination proved I was mistaken, as my copy,
  besides all those carefully noted by Dr. Blomfield, contained many other
  emendations, but had <i>not</i> the note at p. 14. of the
  <i>Prometheus</i>. Whoever was the copier or writer of the marginal MSS.
  in my volume, was evidently a Frenchman, as some of the notes are in
  French. The handwriting is very ancient and contracted, and has the
  appearance of being of the early portion of the seventeenth century. The
  most interesting part, however, of the story still remains. Dr. Thomas
  Morell edited the <i>Prometheus</i>, 4to., 1773. The title is as follows:
  <i>Æschyli P. V. cum Stanl. Versione et Scholiis, <span
  class="grk">&alpha;</span>, <span class="grk">&beta;</span>, (et <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span> ineditis), &amp;c.</i> Now these Scholia <span
  class="grk">&gamma;</span>, which he professes to give for the first
  time, I found to be those in the very ancient hand in the margin of my
  volume. He frequently also gives the various marginal readings, and
  styles them "Marg. MS." Moreover he occasionally adopts these notes
  without any acknowledgment, especially where they throw any light on the
  text. The volume then is of great curiosity and value. From a curious
  note at the end of the <i>Prometheus</i>, Morell takes nine iambic lines,
  to which is affixed "Ad Calcem Dramatis MS. Regii." From this it would
  seem the Scholia were taken from a MS. in the Royal Library at Paris.</p>

  <p>We may observe then as a remarkable circumstance, that while Bishop
  Blomfield was describing the copy belonging to Mr. Mitford, a similar
  copy, with more notes, and of equal antiquity as to the MSS. emendations,
  was in existence, and had once been in the possession of, and of much
  assistance to the great Dr. Morell. Where Morell got this volume, and how
  he should not have acknowledged the aid he derived from it, is a mystery.
  As I mentioned before, the handwriting is far prior to Morell's day. The
  volume is rendered still more interesting by its having many of Stanley's
  emendations, about which such a controversy arose from the observations
  made by Blomfield in his preface to the <i>Agamemnon</i>. And I am almost
  induced to think it might originally have belonged to Stanley, who made a
  similar use of it to what Morell did. Many of the emendations are
  <i>still inedited</i>. This valuable volume, therefore, is of great
  interest, (1) from the vast number of MSS. readings, and (2) from its
  having been formerly in the possession of Dr. Morell, and the
  circumstances above mentioned. It is a very large and clean copy of the
  now scarce edition of H. Stephens; and your bibliographical readers will
  be astonished to hear I purchased it for <i>one shilling</i>! I may
  mention I showed it to the Bishop of London and Dr. Wordsworth, Canon of
  Westminster, who were both interested with it. The latter showed me in
  return several volumes of MSS. collections for a new edition of Æschylus,
  made by his lamented brother the late Mr. John Wordsworth, Fellow of
  Trinity College, Cambridge, perhaps the profoundest Greek scholar next to
  Porson the University of Cambridge ever possessed, and who so ably
  reviewed Professor Scholefield's Æschylus in the <i>Philological
  Museum</i>. The classical world can never sufficiently regret that death
  prevented us from receiving at his hands a first-rate edition of this
  noble poet, as he had been at much pains in travelling all over the
  Continent, and examining all the MSS. extant; and from his known
  partiality to the author, and <!-- Page 605 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page605"></a>{605}</span>vast learning, would doubtless have done
  ample justice to his task.</p>

<h3>ON A PASSAGE IN THE "MERCHANT OF VENICE," ACT III. SC. 2.</h3>

  <p>The passage in which I am about to propose some verbal corrections has
  already been in part examined by your correspondent A. E. B. in p. 483.
  of this volume; but the points, except one, to which I advert, have not
  been touched by that gentleman. The first folio reads thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus ornament is but the <i>guiled</i> shore</p>
      <p>To a most dangerous sea, the beauteous scarfe</p>
      <p>Vailing an Indian <i>beautie</i>; In a word,</p>
      <p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
      <p>To intrap the wisest. Therefore then, thou gaudie gold,</p>
      <p>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee,</p>
      <p>Nor none of thee, thou <i>pale</i> and common drudge</p>
      <p>Tweene man and man; but thou, thou meager lead,</p>
      <p>Which rather threatnest than doth promise ought,</p>
      <p>Thy palenesse moves me more than eloquence,</p>
      <p>And here choose I, joy be the consequence."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word <i>guiled</i> in the first line is printed <i>guilded</i> in
  the second folio, the form in which <i>gilded</i> appears often in the
  old copies. I have no doubt that this is the true reading, and it would
  obviate the difficulty of supposing that Shakspeare wrote guil<i>ed</i>
  for guil<i>ing</i>.</p>

  <p>In Henry Peacham's <i>Minerva Britanna</i>, 1612, p. 207., of
  <i>deceitful</i> "court favour" it is said:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"She beares about a holy-water brush,</p>
      <p>Wherewith her bountie round about she throwes</p>
      <p>Fair promises, good wordes, and gallant showes:</p>
      <p>Herewith a knot of <i>guilded</i> hookes she beares," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Notwithstanding your correspondent's ingenious argument to show that
  <i>beautie</i> in the third line may be the true reading, I cannot but
  think that it is a mistake of the compositor caught from <i>beauteous</i>
  in the preceding line; and that <i>gypsie</i> was the word used by the
  poet, who thus designates Cleopatra. The words in their old form might
  well be confused. For "thou <i>pale</i> and common drudge," in the
  seventh line, I unhesitatingly read "thou <i>stale</i> and common
  drudge;" and, by so doing, avoid the repetition of the same epithet to
  silver and lead. It is evident that the epithet applied to silver should
  be a depreciating one; while <i>paleness</i> is said to <i>move more than
  eloquence</i>. The following passage in <i>King Henry IV.</i>, Part I.
  Act III. Sc. 2. confirms this reading:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"So <i>common</i> hackney'd in the eyes of men,</p>
      <p>So <i>stale</i> and cheap."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To obviate the repetition, Warburton altered <i>paleness</i> to
  <i>plainness</i>, but <i>paleness</i> was the appropriate epithet for
  lead. Thus, Baret has, "<i>Palenesse or wannesse</i> like lead.
  Ternissure."</p>

  <p>And in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act II. Sc. 5., we have:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Unwieldly, slow, heavy and <i>pale as lead</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>With these simple and, most of them, obvious corrections, I submit the
  passage to the impartial consideration of those who with me think that
  our immortal poet, so consummate a master of English, has been here, as
  elsewhere, rendered obscure, if not absurd, by the blunders of the
  printer. It will then run thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thus ornament is but the <i>gilded</i> shore</p>
      <p>To a most dangerous sea: the beauteous scarf</p>
      <p>Veiling an Indian <i>gipsy</i>; in a word,</p>
      <p>The seeming truth which cunning times put on</p>
      <p>To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold</p>
      <p>Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee:</p>
      <p>Nor none of thee, thou <i>stale</i> and common drudge</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,</p>
      <p>Which rather threat'nest than doth promise aught,</p>
      <p>Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence,</p>
      <p>And here choose I; joy be the consequence!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I may just observe, that in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act II. Sc.
  2., the quarto copies have printed <i>pale</i> for <i>stale</i>, which is
  corrected in the folio.</p>

<h3>EPISODE OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.</h3>

<p class="ac"><i>Mademoiselle de Sombreuil and the Glass of Blood.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"... In the Abbaye, Sombreuil, the venerable Governor of the
  Invalides, was brought up to the table, and Maillard had pronounced the
  words 'à la Force,' when the Governor's daughter, likewise a prisoner,
  rushed through pikes and sabres, clasped her old father in her arms so
  tightly that none could separate her from him, and made such piteous
  cries and prayers that some were touched. She vowed that her father was
  no aristocrat, that she herself hated aristocrats. But to put her to a
  further proof, or to indulge their bestial caprices, the ruffians
  presented to her a cup full of blood, and said 'Drink! drink of the blood
  of the aristocrats, and your father shall be saved!' The lady took the
  horrible cup, and drank and the monsters kept their promise."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus, in relating the massacres of September, writes the author of
  Knight's <i>Pictorial Hist. of Engl.</i> (Reign of Geo. III., vol. iii.
  p. 160.); and thus tradition has handed down to us this most horrible
  episode of the first French revolution; one which made so deep an
  impression on my own mind, that the scene was always uppermost whenever
  the atrocities committed during that eventful period of French history
  were under consideration. This impression, I am glad to say, has now been
  removed by M. Granier de Cassagnac, who (<i>Histoire du Directoire</i>)
  states that the tradition is not founded on fact; and as it is the first
  denial of the event which has come under my notice, I send you the
  substance of the evidence which M. de Cassagnac brings forward in support
  of his statement:&mdash; <!-- Page 606 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page606"></a>{606}</span></p>

  <p>1. The Marquise de Fausse-Lendry, in her work, <i>Quelques-uns des
  Fruits amers de la Révolution</i>, does not make any allusion to the
  fact, although she was in the same chamber with Mlle. de Sombreuil, and
  relates her heroic devotion to her father.</p>

  <p>2. Peltier, who was in Paris at the time, and published his
  <i>Histoire de la Révolution du 10 Août</i> early in 1793, does not say a
  word as to the occurrence.</p>

  <p>3. The report of Piette, which was drawn up in Mlle. de Sombreuil's
  favour, and from details supplied by herself, is completely silent on the
  matter.</p>

  <p>4. Being arrested with her father, and her younger brother, Mlle. de
  Sombreuil was taken to the Prison de la Bourbe on the 31st of December,
  1793. One of the prisoners thus notices the event in his journal:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Du 11 Nivôse, an II.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"L'on amena aussi a famille Sombreuil, le père, le fils, et la fille:
  tout le monde sait que cette courageuse citoyenne se précipita, dans les
  journées du mois de Septembre, entre son père et le fer des assassins, et
  parvint à l'arracher de leurs mains. Depuis, sa tendresse n'avait fait
  que s'accroître, et il n'est sorte de soins qu'elle ne prodiguât à son
  père, malgré les horribles convulsions qui la tourmentaient tous les
  mois, pendant trois jours, depuis cette lamentable époque. Quand elle
  parut au salon, tous les yeux se fixèrent sur elle et se remplirent de
  larmes."&mdash;<i>Tableau des Prisons de Paris sous Robespierre</i>, p.
  93.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Here again, not a word about the glass of blood, although the
  narrative was written at no very distant period from the occurrences of
  September.</p>

  <p>Maton de la Varennes, in his <i>Hist. particulière des Evènemens</i>,
  written subsequent to the events of Fructidor, year V., is enthusiastic
  in his praise of Mlle. de S.'s devotion; but says not a word as to the
  horrible sacrifice by which she is represented to have purchased her
  father's life.</p>

  <p>The tradition is found for the first time in print in a note to
  Legouvé's <i>Mérite des Femmes</i>, which appeared in 1801; and the
  subject has been consecrated by the pen of the exiled poet Victor Hugo,
  in an ode to Mlle. de Sombreuil. Since then M. Thiers, without further
  looking into the matter, has given place to it in his <i>Hist. de la
  Révolut. Française</i>:</p>

  <p>Victor Hugo's lines are the following:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"S'élançant au travers des armes:</p>
      <p>&mdash;Mes amis, respectez ses jours!</p>
      <p>&mdash;Crois-tu nous fléchir par tes larmes?</p>
      <p>&mdash;Oh! je vous bénirai toujours!</p>
      <p>C'est sa fille qui vous implore;</p>
      <p>Rendez-le moi; qu'il vive encore!</p>
      <p>&mdash;Vois-tu le fer déjà levé;</p>
      <p>Crains d'irriter notre colère;</p>
      <p>Et si tu veux sauver ton père,</p>
      <p>Bois ce sang....&mdash;Mon père est sauvé!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The subsequent history of this unfortunate family was this. M. de
  Sombreuil and his youngest son perished on the scaffold, the 10th June,
  1794. The elder brother, Charles de Sombreuil, was shot at Vannes in
  June, 1795, after the Quiberon expedition. Leaving prison and France,
  after the 9th Thermidor, Mlle. de S. married an emigrant, the Comte de
  Villelume, who, under the Restoration, became governor of the Invalides
  at Avignon, at which place she died in 1823.</p>

<h3>MILTON INDEBTED TO TACITUS.</h3>

  <p>There is perhaps nothing in "Lycidas" which has so commended itself to
  the memory and lips of men, as that exquisite strain of tender regret and
  pathetic despondency in which occur the lines&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Fame is the spur which the clear spirit doth raise</p>
      <p>(That last infirmity of noble mind)</p>
      <p>To scorn delights, and live laborious days."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is with no desire to impair our admiration of these noble lines
  that I would ask, if that graceful glorifying of Fame as "the last
  infirmity of noble minds" was not suggested by the profound remark of
  Tacitus, in his character of the stoical republican, Helvidius Priscus
  (<i>Hist.</i>, l. iv. c. 6.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Erant, quibus appetentior famæ videretur, quando etiam sapientibus
  cupido gloriæ novissima exuitur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The great Englishman has condensed and intensified the expression of
  the concise and earnest Roman. This is one of those delightful
  obligations which repay themselves: Milton has more than returned the
  favour of the borrowed thought by lending it a heightened expression.</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Note by Warton on Aristotle's "Poetics."</i>&mdash;Some of your
  correspondents having expressed a wish that the MS. remarks of eminent
  scholars, when met with by your readers, might be communicated to the
  world through your pages, I beg to send you the following observations,
  signed <i>J. Warton</i>, which I have found on the blank leaf of a copy
  of Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i> (edit. of Ruddimannos, Edinb.
  1731):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"To attempt to understand poetry without having diligently digested
  this treatise, would be as absurd and impossible as to pretend to a skill
  in geometry without having studied Euclid. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and
  sixteenth chapters, wherein he has pointed out the properest methods of
  exciting terror and pity, convince us that he was intimately acquainted
  with those objects which most forcibly affect the heart. The prime
  excellence of this precious treatise is the scholastic precision and
  philosophical clearness with which the subject is handled, without any
  address to <!-- Page 607 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page607"></a>{607}</span>the passions or imagination. It is to be
  lamented that the part of the Poeticks in which he has given precepts for
  comedy did not likewise descend to posterity."</p>

  <p>A considerable number of notes, in the same handwriting, are also in
  the volume.</p>

  <p><i>Misappropriated Quotation.</i>&mdash;I have heard the following
  passage of Lord Bacon's, Essay VIII., and by a Cambridge D.D. too, so far
  as the word "fortune," attributed to Paley:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He that hath a wife and children hath given hostages to fortune, for
  they are impediments to great enterprises. The best works of the greatest
  merit for the public have proceeded from unmarried and childless
  men."</p>

  <p><i>The God Arciacon.</i>&mdash;In a <i>Descriptive Account of the
  Antiquities in the Grounds and in the Museum of the Yorkshire
  Philosophical Society</i>, drawn up by the learned Curator of the
  antiquities, at page 20. I find the following inscription and
  explanation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"N. III. An altar recently discovered in the rubble foundation, under
  one of the pillars of the church of St. Dionis, Walmgate, York. It is
  inscribed:</p>

<p class="ac">DEO<br/>
ARCIACON<br/>
ET N. AVG. SI<br/>
MAT. VITALIS<br/>
ORD V. S. LM.</p>

  <p>Which may be read thus: <span class="sm">DEO</span> Arciacon et Numini
  Augusti Simatius Vitalis Ordovix Votum solvit libens merito, <i>i.e.</i>
  To the God Arciacon and to the Divinity of Augustus, Simatius Vitalis,
  one of the Ordovices, discharges his vow willingly,
  deservedly&mdash;namely, by dedicating this altar. There is nothing in
  this inscription to indicate its date, or the Emperor to whose divinity,
  in part, the altar is dedicated. The god Arciacon, whose name occurs in
  no other inscription, was probably one of those local deities to whom the
  Roman legions were so prone to pay religious reverence, especially if in
  the attributes ascribed to them they bore any resemblance to the gods of
  their own country. If the reading and interpretation of <span
  class="sm">ORD</span> be right, Vitalis was a Briton; and Arciacon may
  have been a deity acknowledged by the Ordovices, who occupied the
  northern parts of Wales."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the name <span class="sm">ARCIACON</span> I fancy that I see in a
  Latinized form the British words <span class="sm">ARCH IACHAWR</span>,
  <i>i.e.</i> the Supreme Healer. <i>Arch</i> has the same meaning in Welsh
  as it has in the English and several other languages. In combination it
  is shortened to <i>Ar</i>, as in Yr Arglwdd Dduw, the Lord God. My
  conjecture is, that the Britons may have worshipped a God whose
  attributes resembled those of the Æsculapius of the Greeks. I hope that
  some of the contributors to "N. &amp; Q." will be so kind as to give some
  information on this subject.</p>

  Tyrwhitt; but perhaps the following passage may suggest a new reading in
  addition to "cat-tothed" and "gap-tothed," which he gives in his note on
  <i>Canterbury Tales</i>, p. 470.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Doctor deriveth his pedigree from Grono ap Heylyn, who descended

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THOMAS GILL, THE BLIND MAN OF ST. EDMUNDSBURY.</h3>

  <p>Putting in order this morning a mass of pamphlets, which my women-kind
  threaten to sweep into the kitchen unless more <i>tidily</i> kept, I came
  upon a few poetical tracts by "Thomas Gill, the Blind Man of St.
  Edmundsbury." Not having had any previous acquaintance with this poetical
  moralist, I have looked over the lot; but beyond the above description of
  himself upon their titles, they afford little information regarding their
  author.</p>

  <p>There is, however, proof, in <i>The Blind Man's Case at London</i>,
  1711, that Gill was a character in his day. In what he loftily calls "The
  Argument" to these eight pages of doggrel, he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Blind Man of Bury by the Persuasions of his Printer, and some

<h3>BRONZE MEDALS.</h3>

  <p>Having applied in vain to several distinguished numismatists
  respecting certain bronze medals in my cabinet, which have baffled my own
  researches, I now beg to seek for information through the medium of "N.
  &amp; Q.," to which I have been already much indebted; and have little
  doubt but that among your many intelligent correspondents some one will
  be found to solve my difficulties.</p>

  <p>The medals to which I refer, and which I will describe very briefly,
  are the following; and I am desirous of obtaining some account of the
  persons in whose honour they were struck:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. <i>Astalia.</i> Size (Mionnet's scale), 16. "Diva Julia Astalia."
  Bust to the left. Rev. "Unicum for. et pud. Exemplum." A ph&oelig;nix
  rising from its ashes. Probably not later than the early part of the
  sixteenth century.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Conestagius.</i> Size, 15½. "Hieronimus Conestagius, <span
  class="sm">MDXC</span>." Bust in armour to the right, with ruff round the
  neck. Beneath, "<span class="sm">MART. S***.</span>" Rev. A pen and a
  sword in saltire. An oval in high relief, of Italian workmanship.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Meratus.</i> Size, 13½. "Franciscus Meratus <span
  class="sm">I.P.F.</span>" Bearded bust to the right. Rev. "Me Duce Tutus
  Eris." A figure seated holding a book in its right hand. Query the
  meaning of the initials after the name?</p>

  <p>4. <i>Aragonia.</i> Size, 13. "D. Maria Aragonia." Bust to the right,
  with a crown falling from her head. Rev. None.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Hanna.</i> Size, 18. "Martinus de Hanna." Bust in a gown, to the
  right. Rev. "Spes mea in Deo est." A full-length figure, with hands
  clasped and raised towards heaven: apparently a foreign Protestant
  divine.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Corsi.</i> Size, 20. "Laura Corsi March. Salviati." Hooded bust
  to the left, with crucifix suspended from the neck. Beneath, "<span
  class="sm">MDCCVIII.</span>" Rev. "Mens immota manet." Full-length female
  figure, with helmet on her head, leaning on a spear round which a serpent
  is twined, with a stag by her side. In the background, on one side, is
  represented a castle on a wooded height; on the other, a vessel is seen
  labouring in a storm. A striking medal; and the lady's portrait makes one
  feel interested to learn her history, which seemingly ought to be known:
  but I must confess my ignorance even whether the Marquisate of Salviati
  be in Italy or Sicily.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;John de Silvâ, Count de Portalegre, who accompanied Don
  Sebastian in his expedition to Africa against Muley Moloch, published at
  Genoa in 1585 a work entitled <i>Dell' Unione del Regno di Portogallo
  alla Corona di Castiglia</i>, under the name of <i>Conestaggio</i>; but
  not having the book by me, I do not know whether the Christian name
  "Geronimo" also appears.</p>

<h3>ACWORTH QUERIES.</h3>

  <p>In the church of St. Mary Luton, Beds, there is a brass slab bearing
  the figures of a knight and his two wives, with the following
  inscription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pray for the soules of John Acworth Squyer and Alys and Amy his
  wyfes, which John deceased the xvij day of March the yer of our Lord
  <span class="sm"><span
  class="nw">M</span>&prime;v<sup>c</sup>xiij.</span> On whose souls Jhu
  have mercy."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>For arms, he bore quarterly, 1st and 4th, erm. on a chief indented gu.
  3 coronets or. 2nd and 3rd, or, between 3 roses a chev. gu.</p>

  <p>In the reign of Henry VIII. there was one Johan Acworth (a lady of the
  bedchamber to Katherine Howard), who married Sir John Bulmer, and went to
  reside at York.</p>

  <p>John Acworth was, I believe, succeeded by his son, George Acworth, who
  married Margaret, the <!-- Page 609 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page609"></a>{609}</span>daughter of &mdash; Wilborefoss, of
  Durham, Esquire, and had issue a daughter, Johan Acworth. This Johan
  Acworth married Sir Edward Waldegrave, the youngest son of George
  Waldegrave, of Smalbridge, Essex, Esq. I do not know if George Acworth
  had any other issue.</p>

  <p>In 1560 there was a George Acworth who was public orator of Cambridge.
  He was formerly of Peterhouse, and took his D.C.L. at St. John's, Oxon.
  He was in his early days the friend and companion of Archbishop Parker.
  In 1576, he was appointed Master of the Faculties, Judge of the Prer.
  Court of Ireland. He is said to have died in Ireland, but where or when I
  do not know.</p>

  <p>There was another of the name, Allin Acworth, formerly of Magdalen
  Hall, Oxon, and Vicar of St. Nicholas, Rochester, Kent. He was a sufferer
  by the Act of Uniformity, having been, in consequence of that Act,
  expelled his vicarage in 1666. Of his subsequent history I find no
  trace.</p>

  <p>If any of your correspondents can give me any information relative to
  any of the above, their descent, or intermarriages, I shall be much
  obliged.</p>

  <p>The name is, I believe, an uncommon one, and is only borne, as far as
  I can learn, by one family now in existence. There was, however, another
  family of the name formerly belonging to Suffolk, who bore for arms: Sa.
  a griffin segreant armed and langued or. But I cannot find any trace of
  their residence, &amp;c., or when they flourished or became extinct.</p>

  <p>I believe there was a Baron of the name in the reign of one of the
  early Henries, but unfortunately can discover no certain information
  about him.</p>

  <p>The above particulars are wanted for genealogical purposes.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p>"<i>Row the boat, Norman.</i>"&mdash;In the <i>Chronicles of
  England</i> collected by John Stow, and printed in 1580, is the following
  passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1454. John Norman, Draper, Maior. Before thys time the Maiors,
  Aldermen, and Commoners of the Citie of London were wonte all to ride to
  Westminster when the Maior should take hys charge, but this Maior was
  rowed thyther by water; for the whiche the watermen made of hym a song,
  'Rowe the boate, Norman,' &amp;c."</p>

  <p>Are any of your correspondents in possession of the words of this
  song? or is the tune to which it was sung known?</p>

  <p class="author">T. G. H.</p>

  <p><i>The Hereditary Standard Bearer.</i>&mdash;In Crawford's <i>Peerage
  of Scotland</i> it is mentioned, that in the year 1107 Alexander I., by a
  special grant, appointed a member of the Carron family (to whom he gave
  the name of Scrimgeour, for his valour in a <i>sharp fight</i>) the
  office of Hereditary Standard Bearer. Can you inform me how the
  Scrimgeours were deprived of this honour? The family is not extinct, and
  yet I see the Hereditary Royal Standard Bearer is now a Wedderburne, and
  the Earl of Lauderdale is also Hereditary Standard Bearer. There surely
  must have been injustice committed some time to cause such confusion.
  When and how did it take place?</p>

  <p class="author">T. G. H.</p>

  <p><i>Walton's Angler; Seth's Pillars; May-butter; English
  Guzman.</i>&mdash;In Walton's <i>Complete Angler</i>, in the beginning of
  the discourse between Piscator and Venator, the former, expatiating on
  the antiquity of the art of angling, gives as one of the traditions of
  its origin, that Seth, one of the sons of Adam,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Left it engraven on those pillars which he erected, and trusted to
  preserve the knowledge of the mathematics, music, and the rest of that
  precious knowledge, and those useful arts which, by God's appointment or
  allowance, and his noble industry, were thereby preserved from perishing
  in Noah's flood."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What is the tradition of Seth's Pillars?</p>

  <p>Piscator in chap. v. says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But I promise to tell you more of the fly-fishing for a trout, which
  I may have time enough to do, for you see it rains May-butter."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>What is May-butter, or the origin of the saying?</p>

  <p>In the amusing contest between the gypsies related in the same
  chapter, these worthies were too wise to go to law about the residuary
  shilling, and did therefore choose their choice friends Rook and Shark,
  and our late English Guzman, to be their arbitrators and umpires.</p>

  <p>What is the explanation of these names? There appears to be some
  natural consequence to this choice, for the decision seems to have been
  arrived at by the act of reference. The notes explain that by "our
  English Guzman"<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> was intended one James, a noted
  thief. I suppose his prototype was Don Guzman D'Alfarache; but no
  interpretation of the passage is given. Would it be found to have
  reference to some passage in the book referred to in the note?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Anon.</span></p>

  <a name="footnote3"></a><b>Footnote 3:</b><a

  <p>[Sir Harris Nicolas says: "The allusion is to a work which had
  appeared three years before: <i>The English Gusman; or, the History of
  that unparalleled Thief, James Hind</i>, written by G. F. [George Fidge]
  4to., London, 1652. Hind appears to have been the greatest thief of his
  age; the son of a saddler at Chipping Norton, and apprenticed to a
  butcher. In the rebellion he attached himself to the royal cause, and was
  actively engaged in the battles of Worcester and Warrington. In 1651, he
  was arrested by order of parliament, under the name of Brown, 'at one
  Denzy's, a barber over against St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet Street;' which
  circumstance may have introduced him to Walton's notice."&mdash;<span

  to Carew Castle, the magnificent remains of which entitle it to be called
  the ruined Windsor of Wales.</p>

  indication of this practice, and in them there are no tails lopped of
  their fair proportions.</p>

  <p>What other nations besides the English have ever docked their horses'
  tails; and where is any account to be found of their reasons for so
  doing?</p>

  <p><i>St. Albans, William, Abbot of.</i>&mdash;Archbishop Morton
  addressed a monition in 1490 to William, Abbot of St. Albans. It is to be
  found in Wilkin's <i>Concilia</i>, iii. 632., and is extracted from
  Archbishop Morton's <i>Register</i>, fol. 22. b. Now, in Tanner's
  <i>Notitia</i>, and in Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, it is stated that
  William Wallingford, Abbot of St. Albans, died in 1484; and that the
  chair was vacant until 1492, when Thomas Ramryge was elected abbot.
  Archbishop Morton's original letter is, I believe, to be seen in the
  register at Lambeth, and its date is distinctly 1490. This date,
  moreover, agrees with the Excerpta of Dr. Ducarel in the British
  Museum.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers solve this difficulty for me, as I am anxious

  <p><i>Colonel or Major-General Lee.</i>&mdash;The dates of his letters
  tend to prove that Lee was on the continent in 1770, and this is
  apparently borne out by the "memoirs" published both in America and in
  England. But Dr. Girdleston, in his strange work published in 1813,
  asserts that on the 20th April, 1770, at the christening of Sir Charles
  Davis's eldest son, Charles Sydney, Lee was at Rushbrooke in Suffolk. The
  proof, however, is not adduced in a simple and straightforward manner. At
  page 6, Dr. Girdlestone tells us that some person, not named, remembers
  that Lee stood sponsor, &amp;c.; at page 7, that the register proves that
  the baptism took place on the 20th April, 1770; and at page 13, that the
  register proves that Lee was on the 20th April "in that church." This
  last is the only fact bearing on the question at issue. Will any of your
  intelligent correspondents residing at Bury favour you with a copy of the
  register of the baptism of Charles Sydney on the 20th April, 1770?</p>

<h3>CARLING SUNDAY&mdash;ROMAN FUNERAL PILE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. iii., p. 449.; Vol. iv., p. 381.; Vol. v., p. 67.)</p>

  <p>At Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and many other places in the North of England,
  grey peas, after having been steeped a night in water, are fried with
  butter, given away, and eaten at a kind of entertainment on the Sunday
  preceding Palm Sunday, which <!-- Page 612 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page612"></a>{612}</span>was formerly called Care or Carle Sunday,
  as may be yet seen in some of our old almanacks. They are called
  <i>carlings</i>, probably, as we call the presents at fairs,
  <i>fairings</i>. Marshal, in his <i>Observations on the Saxon
  Gospels</i>, tells us that "the Friday on which Christ was crucified is
  called in German both Gute Freytag and Carr Freytag;" that the word
  <i>karr</i> signifies a satisfaction for a fine or penalty; and that Care
  or Carr Sunday was not unknown to the English in his time, at least to
  such as lived among old people in the country.</p>

  <p>In the old Roman calendar I find it observed on this day (the 12th of
  March), that a dole is made of soft beans. I can hardly entertain a doubt
  but that our custom is derived from hence. It was usual among the
  Romanists to give away beans in the doles at funerals; it was also a rite
  in the funeral ceremonies of heathen Rome. There is a great deal of
  learning in Erasmus's <i>Adages</i> concerning <i>the religious use of
  beans</i>, which were thought to belong to the dead. An observation which
  he gives us of Pliny concerning Pythagoras's interdiction of the pulse,
  is highly remarkable. It is "that beans contain the souls of the dead."
  For which cause also they were used in the Parentalia. Plutarch also, he
  tells us, held that pulse to be of the highest efficacy for invoking the
  manes. Ridiculous and absurd as these superstitions may appear, it is yet
  certain that our <i>carlings</i> deduce their origin from thence. On the
  interdiction of this pulse by Pythagoras, the following occurs in Spencer
  <i>De Leg. Hebr.</i>, lib. i. p. 1154.:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Quid enim Pythagoras, ejusque præceptores, Ægypti Mystæ, adeo
  leguminum, fabarum imprimis, esum et aspectum fugerent; nisi quod cibi
  mortuorum c&oelig;nis et exequiis proprii, adeoque polluti et abominandi
  haberentur," &amp;c.&mdash;Brand's <i>Observations on Popular
  Antiquities</i>, Ellis's ed., vol. i. pp. 95-99.</p>

  commemorations of the dead," v. <i>Gregorii Opusc.</i>, p. 128. The
  length of this reply will not admit of my here enumerating the other
  emblems of the resurrection of the body used by the fathers and other
  writers. I shall therefore conclude with an extract from Rennel's
  <i>Geographical System of Herodotus</i>, p. 632., relating to the
  Pythagorean prohibition of beans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Bengalese have the <i>Nymphæa nelumbo</i> in their lakes and
  inundations; and its fruit certainly resembles at all points that of the
  second species of water-lily described by Herodotus; that is, it has the
  form of the orbicular wasp's nest; and contains kernels of the size and
  shape of a small bean. Amongst the Bramins this plant is held
  <i>sacred</i>; but the kernels, which are of a better flavour than
  almonds, are almost universally eaten by the Hindoos.</p>

  <p>"It may, however, be a question whether it has always been the case;
  and whether in the lapse of time that has taken place since the days of
  Pythagoras (who is supposed to have visited India, as well as Chaldæa,
  Persia, and Egypt), a relaxation in discipline may not have occasioned
  the law to be dispensed with; instances enough of a like kind being to be
  met with elsewhere. <i>Kyamos</i> in the Greek language appears to
  signify, not only a bean, but also the fruit or bean of the <i>Nymphæa
  nelumbo</i>. Is it not probable then that the mystery of the famous
  inhibition of Pythagoras, an enigma of which neither the ancients nor the
  moderns have hitherto been able to give a rational solution, may be
  discovered in those curious records of Sanscrit erudition, which the
  meritorious labours of some of our countrymen in India are gradually
  bringing to light?"</p>

<h3>HART AND MOHUN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 466.)</p>

  <p>In Downes' <i>Roscius Anglicanus</i>, edit. 1789, mention is made of
  these two actors, thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hart was apprentice to Robinson, an actor who lived before the Civil
  Wars; he afterwards had a captain's commission, and fought for Charles I.
  He acted women's parts when a boy.</p>

  <p>"Mohun was brought up under Robinson, as Hart and others were: in his
  youth he acted Bellamente, in <i>Love's Cruelty</i>, which part he
  retained after the Restoration."&mdash;Page 10.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appears to have been the practice of the old actors&mdash;the
  "master actors," as they were called&mdash;to take youths as apprentices,
  and to initiate them in female characters, as a preparatory step towards
  something weightier. Richard Robinson, above-mentioned, <i>circa</i>
  1616, usually performed female characters himself.<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In 1647 his name occurs, with
  several others, prefixed to the dedication of the first folio edition of
  Fletcher's <i>Plays</i>. He served in the king's army in the civil wars,
  and was killed in an engagement by Harrison, who refused him quarter, and
  who was afterwards hanged at Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>The patent of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, of which Mr. Hart and
  Major Mohun formed part of the company, having descended from Thomas to
  Charles Killigrew&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In 1682 he joined it to Dr. Davenant's patent, whose company acted
  then in Dorset Garden, which, upon the union, were created the King's
  Company: after which Mr. Hart acted no more, having a pension to the day
  of his death from the United Company. I must not omit to mention the
  parts in several plays of some of the actors, wherein they excelled in
  the performance of them. First, Mr. Hart, in the part of Arbaces, in
  <i>King and no King</i>; Amintor, in the <i>Maid's Tagedy</i>; Othello;
  Rollo; Brutus, in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>; Alexander. Towards the latter end
  of his acting, if he <!-- Page 613 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page613"></a>{613}</span>acted in any one of these but once in a
  fortnight, the house was filled as at a new play, especially Alexander;
  he acting that with such grandeur and agreeable majesty, that one of the
  Court was pleased to honour him with this commendation; that Hart might
  teach any king on earth how to comport himself."<a name="footnotetag5"
  href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Rymer's <i>Dissertation on Tragedy</i> he is thus noticed:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The eyes of the audience are prepossessed and charmed by his action,
  before aught of the poet can approach their ears; and to the most
  wretched of characters Hart gives a lustre which dazzles the sight, that
  the deformities of the poet cannot be perceived."</p>

  <p>"He was no less inferior in Comedy; as Mosca, in the <i>Fox</i>; Don
  John, in the <i>Chances</i>; Wildblood, in the <i>Mock Astrologer</i>;
  with sundry other parts. In all the Comedies and Tragedies he was
  concerned, he perform'd with that exactness and perfection that not any
  of his successors have equall'd him."<a name="footnotetag6"
  href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It would seem that through Hart's "excellent action" alone Ben
  Jonson's <i>Catiline</i> (his own favourite play), which had been
  condemned on its first representation, was kept on the stage during the
  reign of Charles II. With Hart this play died.</p>

  <p>Previous to Nell Gwyn's elevation to royal favour, it is said, upon
  the authority of Sir George Etherge, in <i>Lives of the most celebrated
  Beauties, &amp;c.</i>, 1715, she was "protected" by Lacy, and afterwards
  by Hart. Whether this be true or not, it is certain that she received
  instructions in the Thespian art from both of these gentlemen.</p>

  <p>The cause of Hart retiring from the stage was in consequence of his
  being dreadfully afflicted with the stone and gravel, "of which he died
  sometime after, having a salary of forty shillings a week to the day of
  his death."</p>

  <p>Hart's Christian name was Charles. He is believed by Malone to have
  been Shakspeare's great nephew.<a name="footnotetag7"
  href="#footnote7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Major Mohun remained in the "United Company" after Hart's
  retirement.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He was eminent for Volpone; Face, in the <i>Alchemist</i>; Melantius,
  in the <i>Maid's Tragedy</i>; Mardonius, in <i>King and no King</i>;
  Cassius, in <i>Julius Cæsar</i>; Clytus, in <i>Alexander</i>;
  Mithridates, &amp;c. An eminent poet<a name="footnotetag8"
  href="#footnote8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> seeing him act this last, vented
  suddenly this saying: 'Oh, Mohun, Mohun! thou little man of mettle, if I
  should write 100 plays, I'd write a part for thy mouth.' In short, in all
  his parts, he was most accurate and correct."<a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Rymer remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We may remember (however we find this scene of Melanthius and Amintor
  written in the book) that at the Theater we have a good scene acted;
  there is work cut out, and both our Æsopus and Roscius are on the stage
  together. Whatever defect may be in Amintor and Melanthius, Mr. Hart and
  Mr. Mohun are wanting in nothing. To these we owe what is pleasing in the
  scene; and to this scene we may impute the success of the '<i>Maid's
  Tragedy</i>.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Major Mohun's Christian name was Michael.</p>

<h3>BURIAL WITHOUT RELIGIOUS SERVICE&mdash;BURIAL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 466. 549.)</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt, I think, that a burial ground, whether parish
  churchyard or cemetery, so long as it has been consecrated, or even
  licensed by the bishop, is only <i>legally</i> useable for interments
  performed according to "the ecclesiastical laws of this realm;"
  <i>i.e.</i> the burial service, as rubrically directed, must be read by a
  clergyman over the corpse. Whether the bishop would have proceeded by law
  against the clergyman in Carlile's case, supposing he had desisted from
  the service under the protests of the sons, may be questioned; but that
  he could have done so is beyond a doubt. The sixty-eighth canon says,
  that "no minister shall refuse or delay to bury any corpse that is
  brought to the church or churchyard ... in such manner and form as is
  prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer. And if he shall refuse, &amp;c.,
  he shall be suspended by the bishop of the diocese from his ministry by
  the space of three months." The consecration, or episcopal licence, seems
  to tie the burial ground to the burial service, except in the three cases
  of persons who die excommunicated, unbaptised, or by their own hands; and
  I imagine that a clergyman would render himself liable to suspension by
  his bishop, who either allowed interments to take place in the churchyard
  without the burial service, or, on the other hand, used the service in
  unconsecrated or unlicensed ground. By the 3 Ja. I. c. 5., there is a
  penalty for burying a corpse away from the church; but this law is either
  repealed or obsolete. If any services of the church be used by a
  clergyman, except "according to order," I imagine that he renders himself
  liable to penal consequences; but it may be sometimes thought best to
  omit them. Sometimes, however, as in the case of baptisms being allowed
  in drawing-rooms, there is such an intentional oversight as is quite
  indefensible.</p>

  <p>The story which I have heard of Baskerville's burial is as
  follows;&mdash;He died at Birmingham, but was not interred, and his
  corpse was kept in the house in which he had lived. After a time this
  house was sold, and the purchaser of it became embarrassed by the
  unexpected discovery that he was in possession of the old printer's
  mortal remains. He applied to the clergyman of <!-- Page 614 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page614"></a>{614}</span>the parish for release
  from his difficulty; and this gentleman, being a man of the world, said
  that he was the last person who ought to have been consulted, but since
  it was so, the churchyard and the shades of evening afforded a
  remedy.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it is worth adding, that when Sir W. Page Wood, the late
  Solicitor-General, would have brought a bill into parliament to relieve
  dissenters from the payment of church rates, on condition that they
  consented to forego all claim upon the services of the church, including
  of course the burial service, the bargain was declined by them.</p>

<h3>"QUOD NON FECERUNT BARBARI," ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 559.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Breen</span> is mistaken in
  supposing this "epigram" to refer to the Barberini spoliation of the
  Coliseum; it was an equally important and more sacrilegious theft that
  aroused Pasquin's satire and indignation.</p>

  <p>Urban VIII. (Matteo Barberini), 1623-44, had just stripped the dome of
  the Pantheon of the bronze that adorned it, to construct therewith the
  baldacchino over the high altar in St. Peter's. The amount of metal
  obtained, says Venuti, was upwards of 450,250 pounds weight; and upon the
  principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul, the material thus stolen from the
  Madonna was dedicated to the service of San Pietro. Bernini was the
  artist employed, from whose taste, perhaps, little better was to be
  expected; and the baldacchino, though highly ornamented, richly gilt, and
  of imposing dimensions, certainly makes the beholder regret that the
  metal was moved from its original position. It was costly enough too,
  upwards of 20,000<i>l.</i> having been expended upon its production.</p>

  <p>Urban evidently had a practical turn for warfare by no means unusual
  to the possessors of the "holy see," for we find that the surplusage of
  the metal was cast into cannon for the defence of St. Angelo.</p>

  <p>This pope certainly was <i>one</i> of the most unsparing despoilers of
  the Coliseum, inasmuch as the huge pile of the Palazzo Barbarini was
  erected by him with stone supplied solely from that convenient and
  inexpensive quarry. If, however, we reflect that he did but follow the
  example of many of his predecessors (Paul II. built the Palazzo di
  Venezia, and Paul III. the Farnese, from the same exhaustless supply),
  and that the Coliseum was not only much ruined by the "barbarians" during
  the various sieges of Rome, but was used as a fortress by the Frangipani
  in the Middle Ages, the pasquinade quoted by <span class="sc">Mr.
  Breen</span> would hardly have been applicable to Urban's misdeeds in
  that quarter. Nor was the Coliseum at that time consecrated ground, as it
  was not till the year 1750 that Benedict XIV., with a view to protect it
  from future depredation, dedicated it to the memory of the Christian
  martyrs who had perished in its arena. But the Pantheon, consecrated as
  early as <span class="sm">A.D.</span> 608, under the name of S. Maria
  Rotonda, had been respected and spared by all, whether Arian or
  barb-"arian;" and it was reserved for a "Santo Padre" of the seventeenth
  century to despoil a Christian Church, and himself set an example of
  sacrilege to the Christian world. Urban was the sole member of the
  Barberini family (of Florentine extraction) that ever attained the papal
  tiara. The amount of wealth stated to have been amassed by him during his
  pontificate appears almost fabulous.</p>

  <p>The author of the pasquinade in question is, I believe, unknown.</p>

<h3>RESTIVE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 535.)</p>

  <p>I am inclined to think that your correspondents, however deeply they
  may be versed in "Folk-Lore," are generally not much acquainted with
  "Horse-Lore." Such, at least, is the opinion that is warranted by the
  extraordinary nature of the questions (not many in number, it is true)
  which have been put in relation to that subject, and of the replies that
  have been given to them. In the case now before us, J. R. has only
  superficially considered the matter. He takes one out of many definitions
  "in our dictionaries," and on that takes his stand. He is manifestly in
  error. The tempting facility of referring all words similar in appearance
  to the same etymon lies at the root of his mistake; for <i>restive</i>,
  as he will find on more patient investigation, is by our lexicographers
  (Richardson, for example) classed under a different root from
  <i>rest</i>, used to express <i>quiescence</i>, or <i>repose</i>.
  <i>Restive</i>, or more properly <i>restiff</i>, is equivalent to the
  French <i>rétif</i>, or Italian <i>restio</i>; and, as applied to horses,
  means those which resist the will of their rider. Hence, whether in
  standing stock still, in running away, in rearing, in plunging, or in
  kicking, they employ their natural means of defence against the control
  of the cavalier, and may equally be called <i>restiff</i>. In support of
  this view, take the following quotation, to which others might be added.
  It is from Grisone, <i>Ordini di Cavalcare</i>, 4to., 1550:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Se il cavallo è restio, il più delle volte procede per colpa del
  Cavaliero, per una di questi ragioni. Overo il Cavallo è vile, e di poca
  forza, e essendo troppo molestato si abandona e avvilisce di sorte che
  accorando non vuole caminare avante; over è superbo, e gagliardo, e
  dandogli fatica, egli mancandogli un poco di lena, si prevalerà con
  salti, e con aggrupparsi, e con altre malignità, ò fara pur questo dal
  principio che si cavalca, di maniera che se allora conoscerà chi il
  Cavaliero lo teme, <!-- Page 615 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page615"></a>{615}</span>prenderà tant' animo, che usando molte
  ribalderie, si fermerà contra la volontà sua; <i>e di queste due Specie
  di Restii</i> [which J. R. will be pleased to <i>note</i>], la peggior è
  quella che nasce da viltà, e da poca forza."&mdash;Folio 92, verso.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus much for the equestrian part of the subject. With regard to the
  use of the word <i>restive</i> by the author of the <i>Eclipse of
  Faith</i>, that is purely a matter of taste, which it is unnecessary here
  to discuss; but I hope that the foregoing opinion of one who in his day
  passed for the most accomplished horseman of Europe, will suffice to show
  that, in the passage quoted, the term is not so entirely misapplied as J.
  R. supposes.</p>

<h3>MEN OF KENT AND KENTISH MEN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 321.)</p>

  <p>In your answers to Minor Queries (Vol. v., p. 321.) I find it stated,
  that the inhabitants of the part of Kent lying between Rochester and
  London being <i>invicti</i>, have ever since (the Norman Conquest) been
  designated as Men of Kent; while those to the eastward, through whose
  district the Conqueror marched unopposed, are only "Kentish Men."</p>

  <p>As I have always understood that the contrary is the case, and that
  the inhabitants of East Kent are called "Men of Kent," and those in West
  Kent, "Kentish Men"&mdash;because in East Kent the people are less
  intermixed with strangers than in West Kent, from its proximity to the
  metropolis&mdash;I was desirous of correcting what appeared to me to be a
  manifest error: but not finding any direct authority on the point, I
  consulted my friend Charles Sandys, Esq., of Canterbury, as a Kentish
  antiquary, on the subject. And I now send you a letter from that
  gentleman, which you are at liberty to print.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Geo. R. Corner.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Eltham.</p>

<p class="ac"><span class="sm">"'MEN OF KENT,' AND 'KENTISH MEN.'</span></p>

  <p>"I am not aware that any professed treatise has been written or
  published upon our provincial distinction of 'Men of Kent' and 'Kentish
  Men.' That some such traditionary distinction, however, (whatever it may
  be) has existed from time immemorial in our county, cannot be disputed,
  and I think it has an undoubted and unquestionable historic origin, which
  I will endeavour briefly to illustrate.</p>

  <p>"The West Kent Men, according to the tradition, are styled 'Kentish
  Men;' whilst those of East Kent are more emphatically denominated 'Men of
  Kent.'</p>

  <p>"And now for my historical authorities:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"That the East Kent people were denominated from ancient time 'Men of
  Kent,' may, I think, be inferred from the ancient Saxon name of its
  metropolis, <img src="images/cant-wara-burh.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="Cant-wara-burh" title="Cant-wara-burh"
  /> [<i>Canterbury</i>], literally, 'The City of the Men of Kent;' the
  royal city and seat of government of King Ethelbert at the time of the
  arrival of St. Augustine (<span class="sm">A.D.</span> 597) to convert
  our idolatrous Saxon ancestors from the worship of Woden and his kindred
  deities to that of the Saviour of the world.</p>

  <p>"St. Augustine, having succeeded in his holy mission, and having been
  consecrated Archbishop of the Saxons and Angles in Britain, fixed his
  metropolitical see in the royal city of Canterbury, which had been
  granted to him by King Ethelbert on his conversion (who thereupon retired
  to his royal fortress, or Castrum, of Regulbium, <i>Reculver</i>). And in
  that city it has ever since continued for a period of more than twelve
  centuries.</p>

  <p>"The conversion of the Pagan inhabitants of Kent proceeded so rapidly
  that St. Augustine, with the assistance of King Ethelbert, soon founded
  another episcopal see at Rochester, and thus divided the Kentish kingdom
  into two dioceses: the eastern, or diocese of Canterbury; the western, or
  diocese of Rochester. And thus, I conceive, originated the divisions of
  East and West Kent: the men of the former retaining their ancient name of
  'Men of Kent;' whilst those of the latter adopted that of 'Kentish
  Men.'</p>

  <p>"The Saxon (or Jutish) kingdom of Kent continued a separate and
  independent kingdom of the Octarchy from the time of Hengist (<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 455) until its subjugation by Offa, King of
  Mercia, in the eighth century, to which it continued tributary until King
  Egbert reduced all the kingdoms of the Octarchy under his dominion, at
  the commencement of the ninth century,&mdash;and thus became the first
  King of all England.</p>

  <p>"That Kent was separated at an early period into the two divisions of
  East and West Kent, may be inferred from a charter (Kemble, <i>Cod.
  Dipl.</i> ii. 19.) relating to some property withheld from the church of
  Canterbury, and which is specially described as having been that "of
  Oswulf, duke and prince of the province of <i>East Kent</i>" ('dux atque
  princeps provinciæ <i>Orientalis Cantiæ</i>') c. <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 844.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Saxon Chronicle</i> also confirms this view of the matter,
  thus:</p>

  <p><span class="sm">A.D.</span> 853. "Ealhere with the 'Men of Kent'
  fought in <i>Thanet</i> against the heathen army (Danes)."&mdash;Thanet
  is in <i>East</i> Kent.</p>

  <p><span class="sm">A.D.</span> 865. "The heathen army sate down in
  <i>Thanet</i>, and made peace with the 'Men of Kent.' And the 'Men of
  Kent' promised them money for the peace."</p>

  <p><span class="sm">A.D.</span> 902. ... "Battle at the <i>Holmes</i>,
  between the 'Kentish Men' and the 'Danish Men.'&mdash;This, I take it,
  occurred in <i>West</i> Kent.</p>

  <p><span class="sm">A.D.</span> 999. "The army (Danes) went up along the
  Medway to <i>Rochester</i>, and then the '<i>Kentish</i> forces' stoutly
  joined battle ... and full nigh <!-- Page 616 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page616"></a>{616}</span>all the 'West Kentish men' they ruined and
  plundered."</p>

  <p><span class="correction" title="Original reads 'A.B.'."><span
  class="sm">A.D.</span></span> 1009. "Then came the vast hostile army
  (Danes) to <i>Sandwich</i>, and they soon went their way to
  <i>Canterbury</i>; and all the people of '<i>East Kent</i>' made peace
  with the army, and gave them 3000 pounds."</p>

  <p>"Thus, I trust, I have satisfactorily shown from our ancient annals,
  that the distinction between 'Kentish Men' and 'Men of Kent,' existed at
  a period long anterior to the Norman Conquest, and is distinctly
  recognised in the foregoing historical passages. And its origin may, I
  think, be attributed to the ancient division of the Jutish kingdom of
  Kent into the two dioceses of <i>Canterbury</i> and <i>Rochester</i>.</p>

  <p>"Our Gavelkind Tenure and free Kentish customs, of which I have
  attempted a history in my recently published <i>Consuetudines Kanciæ</i>,
  gave rise to our well-known old provincial song of 'The Man of Kent,' its
  burthen being:</p>

  sold at the sale at Hill Court, Gloucester, in 1846. It was bought by a
  bookseller for Mr. Pigott of Brockley; it was resold in 1849, but to whom
  I could never find out. This last is also in three vols.; two of these
  match in the binding, but the third does not: the leather of this odd
  vol. is thickly studded with the <i>portcullis</i>. The imperfection of
  this set consists in being <i>unfinished</i> in many parts. Mr. Huntley's
  is considered the first copy of that at the castle; and that at Condover
  was probably Mr. Smyth's own. The Hill Court copy seems to be about the
  same date.</p>

  <p>The <i>Abstracts and Extracts</i> of these MSS. as published by
  Fosbroke in 1821, are but a tantalising meagre sample of the very rich
  store of genealogical and historical information which the originals
  contain.</p>

  <p><i>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</i> (Vol. v., p. 532.).&mdash;The note
  which appears in p. 532. has induced me to look out a rare old printed
  copy of "The Quack Doctor's Speech," which is in my possession, and which
  was spoken by the witty Lord Rochester, in character, and mounted on a
  stage; it is altogether a very humorous and lengthy address, partaking of
  the licence of language not uncommon to the courtiers of that period,
  abounding in much technical phraseology, and therefore unsuited for an
  introduction into your pages <i>in extenso</i>. The titles assumed,
  however, are in character with the pretensions claimed by virtue of being
  the seventh begotten son of a seventh begotten father; and may perhaps
  prove an interesting addition to the collection of instances recorded by

  <p><i>The Number Seven</i> (Vol. v., p. 533.).&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr.
  Henry Edwards</span> is quite right in his conjecture that the number
  <i>seven</i>, so often used in the Old and New Testament, is generally
  put to mean "several," "many," or an indefinite number. Hence the number
  seven was esteemed a sacred, symbolical, and mystical number. There were
  seven gifts of the Holy Ghost, seven days in the week, seven sacraments,
  seven branches on the candlestick of Moses, seven liberal arts, seven
  churches of Asia, seven mysterious seals, seven stars, seven symbolic
  trumpets, seven heads of the dragon, seven joys and seven sorrows of the
  blessed Virgin, seven penitential psalms, seven deadly sins, seven
  canonical hours, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"Septenarius numerus est numerus universitatis," says J. de Voragine.
  See also, Bede, Duranti, and Rhabanus Maurus, on the mystical explanation
  of this number. A curious French MS. belonging to the latter part of the
  thirteenth century has a singular illustration of the number seven. It is
  a miniature: a wheel cut into seven rays, and composed of seven
  concentric cordons. The rays form seven compartments, divided into as
  many cordons, containing in each cordon one of the seven petitions of the
  Lord's Prayer, one of the seven sacraments, one of the seven spiritual
  arms of justice, one of the seven works of mercy, one of the seven
  virtues, one of the seven deadly sins, and one of the seven gifts of the
  Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p><i>Tortoiseshell Tom Cat</i> (Vol. v., p. 465.).&mdash;I always
  thought the tortoiseshell tom cat was an animal of very rare occurrence;
  but I was not aware, until I read the Note of your correspondent W. R.,
  that it was unknown in natural history. The late (and highly respected)
  Mr. John Bannister, familiarly called "Jack Bannister," wrote, more than
  forty years ago, a humorous and witty <i>jeu d'esprit</i> on this
  subject: this was composed for his "Budget," a species of entertainment
  from which the late Mr. Matthews took the idea of his "At Home;" an
  entertainment exhibiting a most extraordinary range of talent, and must
  be fresh in the memory of most of your readers. It supposes the
  auctioneer, "Mr. Catseye," in the Great Room in "Cateaton Street," and
  opens thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Oh! what a story the papers have been telling us</p>
      <p class="i1">About a little animal of wond'rous price;</p>

      <p class="i2">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>

  <p>Having, humorously described the company assembled, and enlarged on
  the "beauty and rarity" of the animal, it thus concludes:</p>

      <p class="hg3">"Now louder and warmer the competition growing,</p>

  <p><i>A Tombstone cut by Baskerville</i> (Vol. v., p. 209.).&mdash;A
  correspondent complains that on visiting Edgbaston Church he was unable
  to obtain a sight of the tombstone, which he much wished to see. Since I
  read his Note, I have met with the following, which I copy from Pye's
  <i>Modern Birmingham</i>, 1819. After speaking of a monument in
  Handsworth Church, Birmingham, to the late Matthew Boulton, the writer
  proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The other is a humble tombstone, remarkable as being one of the last
  works cut by his own hand, with his name at the top of it, of that
  celebrated typographer, Baskerville; but this, being neglected by the
  relations of the deceased, has been mutilated, although the inscription
  is still perfect, but so much overgrown with moss and weeds, that it
  requires more discrimination than falls to the lot of many passing
  travellers, to discover the situation of this neglected gem. To those who
  are curious it will be found close to the wall, immediately under the
  chancel window. This precious relic of that eminent man is deserving of
  being removed at the expense of the parish, and preserved with the
  greatest care, withinside the church.... There is only one other of his
  cuttings known to be in existence, and that has lately been removed and
  placed withinside the church at Edgbaston&mdash;"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Which is subsequently thus described:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There was in this churchyard a gravestone cut by the hands of the
  celebrated typographer Baskerville, which is now removed and placed
  withinside the church. The stone being of a flaky nature, the inscription
  is not quite perfect, but whoever takes delight in well-formed letters,
  may here be highly gratified; it was erected to the memory of Edw.
  Richards, an idiot, who died 21st September, 1728, with the following
  inscription:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p><i>Shakspeare, Tennyson, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. v., p. 492.).&mdash;The
  editorial note has supplied the Latin parallel, but not "the origin and
  reason of the idea." This Koenig's note to Persius (<span

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Nascentur violæ</i>; Hoc inde videtur natum esse quod veteres

  pertinebat hoc ad religionem manium, qui, ut putabatur, libationibus

  <p>This is the first step. Further:</p>

  <p>"Beatissima mortui conditio, cui <i>vel natura ipsa inferias agat</i>,

  a gentleman of high standing on this island, who has business relations
  with Martinique, that such was the case, and that either the grandmother
  or great-grandmother of the Empress was a negress slave. He had the fact,
  he said, on good local authority, and appeared satisfied in his own mind
  of the truth of the statement. The sudden and surprising elevation of her
  grandson gives some interest to the inquiry.</p>

  <p><i>The Curse of Scotland</i> (Vol. i., pp. 61. 90.; Vol. iii., pp. 22.

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is a common expression made use of at cards, which I have never

  <p>"Looking lately over a book of heraldry I found nine diamonds, or
  lozenges, conjoined, or, in the heraldic language, Gules, a cross of
  lozenges, to be the arms of Packer.</p>

  <p>"Colonel Packer appears to have been one of the persons who was on the
  scaffold when Charles the First was beheaded, and afterwards commanded in
  Scotland, and is recorded to have acted in his command with considerable
  severity. It is possible that his arms might, by a very easy metonymy, be
  called the Curse of Scotland; and the nine of diamonds, at cards, being
  very similar in figure to them, might have ever since retained the
  appellation."&mdash;<i>Gent. Mag.</i>, vol. lvi. p. 301.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell whence he learns that Colonel Packer was on the
  scaffold when King Charles was beheaded."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 390.</p>

  <p>"When the Duke of York (a little before his succession to the crown)
  came to Scotland, he and his suite introduced a new game, there called
  <i>Comet</i>, where the ninth of diamonds is an important card. The Scots
  who were to learn the game, felt it to their cost: and from that
  circumstance the ninth of diamonds was nicknamed the Curse of
  Scotland."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 538.</p>

  <p>"The nine of diamonds is called the Curse of Scotland because it is
  the great winning card at Comette, which was a game introduced into
  Scotland by the French attendants of Mary of Lorraine, queen of James V.,
  to the ruin of many Scotch families."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 968.</p>

  himself sufficiently disposed of Hawksworth's claim, as his wife was

  <p><i>Saint Wilfred's Needle</i> (Vol. v., pp. 510. 573.).&mdash;A very
  interesting account of this curious crypt beneath the central tower of
  Ripon Cathedral will be found in a pamphlet published twelve years ago,
  entitled "<i>Sepulchri a Romanis Constructi infra Ecclesiam S. Wilfridi
  in civitate Reponensi Descriptio Auctore Gul. D. Bruce</i>. London 1841."
  A copy is in the library of the Society of Antiquaries, and another in

  <p><i>Frebord</i> (Vol. v., p. 440.).&mdash;It may possibly assist the
  inquiries of your correspondents <span class="sc">Spes</span> and P. M.
  M. to be informed that the right of Frebord belongs to many estates in
  the midland counties. In some instances in Leicestershire the claim
  extends from the boundary hedge of one lordship to the extent of
  twenty-one feet over the land of the adjoining lordship; it is here
  understood to represent a <i>deer's leap</i>, and is said to have been
  given with the original grant of the manor, in order to secure to the
  lord a right to take the deer he happened to shoot when in the act of
  leaping from his domain into his neighbour's manor.</p>

  <p><i>Royd</i> (Vol. v., p. 571.).&mdash;The meaning of this word may be
  further illustrated by reference to Swiss etymology and history. The
  great battle of Naefels (April 9, 1388) is celebrated on the first
  Thursday of every April, on the spot where the fiercest part of the
  struggle took place. Mount <i>Ruti</i>, the meadow where the liberators
  of Switzerland met, on the lake of the Four Cantons, and opposite
  Brunner, is called the Rutli: both words being derived from a common root
  of common use in the formation of names in German Switzerland,
  <i>Ruten-defricher</i>, "to clear;" or, <i>Ruthen</i>, "to measure,
  gauge;" in short, "prepare for clearing;" whence, perhaps, our
  <i>Ruthyn</i> and Rutland.</p>

  <p><i>Spy Wednesday</i> (Vol. v., p. 511.).&mdash;Your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Mr. Chadwick</span> is informed that the Wednesday in
  Holy Week, <i>i. e.</i> the Wednesday before Easter Sunday, is called
  <i>Spy Wednesday</i>. The term has its origin in the fact, that Judas
  made his compact with the Sanhedrim upon that day for the betrayal of our
  Blessed Saviour. See Matthew, xxvi. 3, 4, 5. 14, 15, and 16.</p>

  <p><i>Book of Jasher</i> (Vol. v., pp. 415. 476. 524.).&mdash;Hartwell
  Horne, in his <i>Introduction</i> (vol. ii. part ii. pp. 132-138. ed.
  1839), has with much diligence exposed both Ilive's original forgery
  (1751) and the "unacknowledged reprint" (1829). He adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There is also extant a Rabbinical Hebrew Book of Jasher printed at
  <i>Venice</i> in 1625, which is an explanation of the histories contained
  in the Pentateuch and Joshua. Barlocci, in his <i>Biblioth.
  Rabbinica</i>, states that it contains some curious but many fabulous
  things; and particularly that this book was discovered at the time of the
  destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem in a certain place, in which an
  old man was shut up, in whose possession a great number of Hebrew books
  were found, and among them the Book of Jasher; which was first carried
  into Spain, and preserved at Seville, whence finally it was taken to
  Naples, where it was first published."&mdash;Vol. iii p. 934.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 621 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page621"></a>{621}</span></p>

  <p>Is this the work published at New York in 1840? I suppose so: at
  least, if "Prof. Noah" has been reproducing the <i>Bristol Book of
  Jasher</i> (1829), he can claim but little of the <i>justice and
  perfectness</i> of his great namesake.</p>

  <p><i>Stearne's (not Hearne's) Confirmation and Discovery of

  most extraordinary of all the treatises on Witchcraft, the only copy I
  ever saw is the one I possess, and which I have fully described in the
  notes to Pott's <i>Discovery of Witches</i>, printed for the Chetham
  Society, p. 4. The Rev. Author was no theorist, but a thoroughly
  practical man; having been an agent in finding and bringing to justice
  200 witches in the eastern counties. He has the subject so perfectly at
  his fingers' ends, and discusses it so scientifically, that Hopkins sinks
  into insignificance by the side of him. Pity it is that such a
  philanthropic individual should have had occasion to complain: "In many
  places I never received penny as yet, nor any am like, except that I
  should sue!!"</p>

  <p><i>Boy Bishop at Eton</i> (Vol. v., p. 557.).&mdash;The festival of
  St. Hugh, <i>Bishop</i> (<i>Pontificis</i>) of Lincoln, was kept on
  November 17.</p>

  <p>For "Nihilensis," in the "Consuetudinarium Etonense," should be read
  "Nicolatensis," as it stands in a Compatus of Winchester College, of the
  date 1461: the Boy Bishop assuming his title on St. Nicholas' Day, Dec.
  6, and then performing his parody of Divine Offices for the first time;
  St. Nicholas of Myra being, according to the legend, the patron of
  children.</p>

  <p>It is singular that, whereas, as in other foundations, the Feast of
  the Holy Innocents was appointed for the mummeries of the Boy Bishop at
  Winchester by the founder, it was forbidden at Eton and King's, although
  the statutes of the latter were borrowed almost literally from those of
  Wykeham. It would therefore appear that there was some local reason for
  the exception.</p>

  <p><i>Plague Stones&mdash;Mr. Mompesson</i> (Vol. v., p. 571.).&mdash;I
  should be sorry that anything inaccurate was recorded in "N. &amp; Q."
  respecting so eminently worthy a person as the Rev. William Mompesson,
  Rector of Eyam during the time that it was scourged by the plague in
  1666, when, out of a population of only 330, 259 died of the disorder.
  Mr. M. himself did not fall a victim, as J. G. C. states; but his wife
  did, and her tomb remains to this day. He was, indeed, an ornament to his
  sacred profession. He not only stood by his flock in the hour of their
  visitation, but he obtained such an influence during the panic that they
  entirely deferred to his judgment, and remained, as he advised, within
  the village. He preached to them on Sundays in the open air from a sort
  of natural pulpit in the rock, now called Cucklet Church; and he
  established the water troughs, or <i>plague stones</i>, into which the
  people dropped their money, in payment for the victuals that were brought
  to them from the surrounding country. When in reward for his devotedness
  the Deanery of Lincoln was offered him, he generously declined it in
  favour of his friend Dr. Fuller, author of the <i>Worthies of
  England</i>, who thus obtained the appointment. Mr. Mompesson was
  subsequently presented to the living of Eakring in Notts, where he died
  in 1708.</p>

  <p>There has recently been discovered on the moor near Fullwood, by
  Sheffield, a chalybeate spring, which flows into a small covered recess
  formed of ashlar stone, and this stands just as it did when the wretched
  inhabitants of Eyam, believing the water to have sanatory virtues, came
  to drink of it, until a watch was placed on the spot by the Sheffield
  people, and they were driven back to their infected homes.</p>

  <p><i>Raleigh's Ring</i> (Vol. v., p. 538.).&mdash;Sir Walter Raleigh's
  ring, which he wore at the time of his execution, is, I believe, in the
  possession of Capt. Edward James Blanckley, of the 6th Foot, now serving
  at the Cape of Good Hope. It is an heirloom in the Blanckley family, of
  which Captain Blanckley is the senior representative, who are directly
  descended from Sir Walter, and have in their possession several
  interesting relics of their great ancestor, viz. a curious tea-pot, and a
  state paper box of iron gilt and red velvet.</p>

  some time ago before the Royal Irish Academy, and which is printed in
  their <i>Proceedings</i>, vol. v. p. 162. I have there noticed a curious
  work by Oengus Cele De, or Oengus the Culdee, a writer of the eighth
  century, in which the word <i>Pandecte</i> (or, as the Irish scribe
  spells it, <i>Pantecte</i>) is used in the same sense as that in which
  Alcuin employs it, for the <i>Bibliotheca</i>, or Bible of St.
  Jerome.</p>

  <p>I have marked the passage, pp. 9, 10. of the enclosed paper, which if

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>If among the writers of the present day there is one whose opinion
  with regard to Robin Hood and the cycle of ballads of which that renowned
  outlaw is the hero would be looked for with anxiety and received with
  respect, it is the Rev. Joseph Hunter, a gentleman in whom are happily
  combined that thorough historical and antiquarian knowledge, and that
  sound poetic taste which are required to do justice to so interesting a
  theme. The announcement, therefore, that the fourth of Mr. Hunter's
  <i>Critical and Historical Tracts</i> is entitled <i>The Great Hero of
  the Ancient Minstrelsy of England, Robin Hood</i>. <i>His Period, real
  Character, &amp;c., investigated, and perhaps ascertained</i>, will be
  received with welcome by all who rejoice "that the world was very guilty
  of such ballads some three ages since," and who, loving them and their
  hero, would fain know something of the history on which they are founded.
  Mr. Hunter dissents, and we think rightly, from two popular and recent
  theories upon the subject,&mdash;the one, that which elevates Robin Hood
  into the chief of a small body of Saxons impatient of their subjection to
  the Norman rule; the other, that which reduces him to one among the
  "personages of the early mythology of the Teutonic people." Mr. Hunter,
  on the other hand, <i>identifies</i> him with one "Robyn Hood" who
  entered the service of Edward II. a little before Christmas 1323, and
  continued therein somewhat less than a twelvemonth:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Alas then said good Robyn,</p>
      <p class="i1">Alas and well a woo,</p>
      <p>If I dwele longer with the kynge</p>
      <p class="i1">Sorowe wyll me sloo:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and the evidence which he adduces in favour of our popular hero having
  been one of the <i>Contrariantes</i> of the reign of the Second Edward;
  and the coincidences which he points out between the minstrel testimony
  of the <i>Little Geste</i> and the testimony of records of different
  kinds and lying in different places, will, we are sure, be read with
  great interest even by those who may not think that our author has quite
  succeeded in unmasking the "Junius" of those olden times.</p>

  <p><i>Richmondshire, its Ancient Lords and Edifices: a Concise Guide to
  the Localities of Interest to the Tourist and Antiquary; with short Notes
  of Memorable Men</i>, by W. Hylton Longstaffe, is a pleasant, chatty, and
  amusing guide to a beautiful locality, which the author describes as "the
  capital of a land whose riches of romance are scarcely exceeded by any
  other in England, the chosen seat of its own Earls, the Scropes,
  Fitzhughs, Marmions; and those setters up and pullers down of kings, the
  richest, noblest, and most prudent race of the North, the lordly
  Nevilles:" and which as such may well tempt the tourist and antiquary to
  visit it during the coming autumn. Those who do will find Mr.
  Longstaffe's little volume a pleasant companion.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;The second volume of
  Charlotte A. Eaton's <i>Rome in the Nineteenth Century, containing, a
  Complete Account of the Ruins of the Ancient City, the Remains of the
  Middle Ages, and the Monuments of Modern Times</i>, which completes this
  lady's excellent guide to the Eternal City.&mdash;The second volume of
  Miss Thomasina Ross's well-executed translation of Humboldt's <i>Personal
  Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America during the
  Years 1799-1804</i>, is the new volume of Bohn's <i>Scientific
  Library</i>.&mdash;<i>The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to
  the Constitution and Course of Nature; to which are added Two Brief
  Dissertations; on Personal Identity, and on the Nature of Virtue; and
  Fifteen Sermons</i>, by Joseph Butler, D.C.L., <i>late Lord Bishop of
  Durham</i>.&mdash;The new volume of Bohn's <i>Standard Library</i> is
  deserving of especial mention. It is a reprint of Bishop Halifax's
  Standard Edition, with the addition of Analytical Introductions, and
  Notes by a Member of the University of Oxford; and we have no doubt will
  be found a really useful <i>popular</i> edition, such as may allure to
  the careful study of one of the best works in our language those minds
  which, without such help, might shrink from the task.</p>

  <p>A MANUAL OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, from the First to the Twelfth
  Century inclusive. By the Rev. E. S. FOULKES, M.A., fellow and Tutor of
  Jesus College, Oxford.</p>

  <p>The main plan of the work has been borrowed from Spanheim, a learned,
  though certainly not unbiassed, writer of the seventeenth century; the
  matter compiled from Spondanus and Spanheim, Mosheim and Fleury, Gieseler
  and Döllinger, and others, who have been used too often to be specified,
  unless when reference to them appeared desirable for the benefit of the
  reader. Yet I believe I have never once trusted to them on a point
  involving controversy, without examining their authorities. The one
  object that I have had before me has been to condense facts, without
  either garbling or omitting any that should be noticed in a work like the
  present, and to give a fair and impartial view of the whole state of the
  case.&mdash;<i>Preface.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"An epitomist of Church History has a task of no ordinary
  greatness.... He must combine the rich faculties of condensation and
  analysis, of judgment in the selection of materials, and calmness in the
  expression of opinions, with that most excellent gift of faith, so
  especially precious to Church historians, which implies a love for the
  Catholic cause, a reverence for its saintly champions, an abhorrence of
  the misdeeds which have defiled it, and a confidence that its 'truth is
  great, and will prevail.'</p>

  <p>"And among other qualifications which may justly be attributed to the
  author of the work before us, this last and highest is particularly
  observable. He writes in a spirit of manly faith, and is not afraid of
  facing 'the horrors and uncertainties,' which, to use his own words, are
  to be found in Church history."&mdash;<i>From the Scottish Ecclesiastical
  Journal, May, 1852.</i></p>

  <p>DR. ROGET'S THESAURUS of ENGLISH WORDS and PHRASES Classified and

  Composition.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There cannot be the slightest doubt that, upon the whole, it is one
  of the most learned as well as one of the most admirable contributions
  that have been made to philology in this country since the 'Hermes' of
  Harris, and the 'Diversions of Purley' by Horne
  Tooke."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

  <p>"Dr. Roget's 'Thesaurus' will be found a most useful supplement to our
  ordinary English dictionaries. Its value will be most recognised by those
  who are best acquainted with the language, and best practised in its use.
  The mere arrangement of the groups of words, unaccompanied by
  definitions, suggests often various ideas associated with the different
  expressions. In such practical operation as translation from a foreign
  language, the utility of such a Thesaurus is obvious."&mdash;<i>Literary
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"The man who in writing cannot find the fit word to express a thought,
  may, if it please him, take down Dr. Roget's 'Thesaurus,' look for the
  class containing any word of similar idea, and there he will find a
  miscellaneous collection, as complete as the compiler could make it, of
  words and phrases from which he may employ his tact to pick the syllables
  that suit him best.... The practical employer of the book will be
  directed to the object of his search by a full Synopsis of Categories at
  the beginning, or a very ample alphabetical index of words placed at the
  end, occupying 170 three-columned pages. The philosophic student of the
  English language may undoubtedly pick up many ideas from the grouping of
  our words and vulgarisms here attempted, and attempted with a great deal
  of success."&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

  <p>THE PRACTICAL WORKING of THE CHURCH OF SPAIN. By the Rev. FREDERICK
  MEYRICK, M.A., Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Pleasant meadows, happy peasants, all holy monks, all holy priests,
  holy every body. Such charity and such unity, when every man was a
  Catholic. I once believed in this Utopia myself but when tested by stern
  facts, it all melts away like dream."&mdash;<i>A. Welby Pugin.</i></p>

  <p>"The revelations made by such writers as Mr. Meyrick in Spain and Mr.
  Gladstone in Italy, have at least vindicated for the Church of England a
  providential and morally defined position, mission, and purpose in the
  Catholic Church."&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>

  <p>"Two valuable works ... to the truthfulness of which we are glad to
  add our own testimony: one, and the most important, is Mr. Meyrick's
  'Practical Working of the Church of Spain.' This is the
  experience&mdash;and it is the experience of every Spanish
  traveller&mdash;of a thoughtful person, as to the lamentable results of
  unchecked Romanism. Here is the solid substantial fact. Spain is divided
  between ultra-infidelity and what is so closely akin to actual idolatry,
  that it can only be controversially, not practically, distinguished from
  it: and over all hangs a lurid cloud of systematic immorality, simply
  frightful to contemplate. We can offer a direct, and even personal,
  testimony to all that Mr. Meyrick has to say."&mdash;<i>Christian
  Remembrancer.</i></p>

  <p>"I wish to recommend it strongly."&mdash;<i>T. K. Arnold's Theological
  Critic.</i></p>

  <p>"Many passing travellers have thrown more or less light upon the state
  of Romanism and Christianity in Spain, according to their objects and
  opportunities; but we suspect these 'workings' are the fullest, the most
  natural, and the most trustworthy, of anything that has appeared upon the
  subject since the time of Blanco White's
  Confessions."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

  <p>"This honest exposition of the practical working of Romanism in Spain,
  of its everyday effects, not its canons and theories, deserves the
  careful study of all, who, unable to test the question abroad, are
  dazzled by the distant mirage with which the Vatican mocks many a
  yearning soul that thirsts after water-brooks pure and
  full."&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>
